Guidelines for Service Token use:
----------------------------------
1) Maintain a list of places where the token is used
2) Always generate new encryption key for each use
3) Use one token for one purpose only (for example, one token for all travis apps)
4) Determine and be aware of scope of vulnerability of the token
5) Never store unencrypted secret on the network
6) Revoke if you have any fear that secret has been compromised
